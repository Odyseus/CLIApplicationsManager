- ``system_executable``: Create an executable for the ``app.py`` application on the system ``PATH`` to be able to run it from anywhere.

    + The system executable creation process will ask for an executable name and the absolute path to store the executable file (the default is ``$HOME/.local/bin``).
    + It will also ask for bash completions creation.
